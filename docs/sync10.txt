 KPI Questions for Dashboard Design

  Per sync9.txt, I need your input before designing the dashboard:

  1. Which KPIs matter most to you as the owner?

  Available metrics from our warehouse:
  - GP% (Gross Profit Margin)
  - GP Dollars (Total Gross Profit)
  - ARO (Average Repair Order Value)
  - Car Count (ROs per day)
  - Billed Hours (Labor hours sold)
  - Effective Labor Rate ($/hour)
  - Revenue (total authorized sales)
  - Gross Profit $ per billed hour (total sales / total labor hours, per ro and per job)** need to add
 
 Rank your top 5 or tell me which ones to highlight prominently. All the above are important but these are top 5
  - Revenue (total authorized sales)
  - Car Count (ROs per day)
  - GP% (Gross Profit Margin)
  - GP Dollars (Total Gross Profit)  - Gross Profit $ per billed hour (total sales / total labor hours, per ro and per job) ** need to add
  - Billed Hours (Labor hours sold)

  2. Which date ranges do you want as defaults?

  Pick the primary views:
  - Today 
  - WTD (Week to Date, M-F only)
  - Last 7 Days
  - MTD (Month to Date)
  - Last 30 Days
  - Custom Range

  Which should be the default when the dashboard loads?
TODAY

  3. How many "views" or personas do you need?

  Options:
  - Owner View - High-level KPIs, trends, all-shop summary
  - Advisor View - Performance by service advisor
  - Tech View - Technician productivity (hours, efficiency)
  - Warranty/No-Charge View - Filter out warranty/internal ROs

  Which views do you actually need? Just owner? Owner + Advisor?
All would be killer

  4. Single-page vs Multi-page?

  - Single-page with sections - All KPIs on one scrollable page with collapsible sections
  - Multi-page tabs - Separate pages for Summary, Advisors, Techs, Trends

  What's your preference?
Multipage
