The sync service implementation looks great, but this all needs to be fully hosted and managed by you, not run manually on my laptop.

Switch into “hosted production” mode now and integrate this with Railway and Supabase using the MCP tools:

Deploy to Railway
Use the Railway MCP to:

Ensure the FastAPI backend (main branch) is deployed as a live web service

Confirm that the service is running and reachable publicly (get the base URL)

Update docs/DEPLOY_LOG.md with the deployment details

Configure environment variables on Railway
All of the following MUST be configured in the Railway service environment (do not assume local .env):

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (service_role key)

Any Tekmetric-related settings you need for sync:
TM_BASE_URL
TM_SHOP_ID (6212 for JJ Auto)
TM_AUTH or TM_API_KEY or whatever token mechanism you use now

Any other required env vars referenced in app/sync/* or main.py

Use the Supabase and TM project details you already know from earlier steps. After setting env vars, rebuild/redeploy the service if needed.

Wire sync jobs to run automatically
We should not have to call curl manually. Set up an automated sync pipeline using Railway:

Either:
a) Configure a Railway cron job or scheduled job that hits the HTTP endpoints like:
/api/sync/employees?shop_id=6212 (maybe daily)
/api/sync/repair-orders?days_back=1&board=POSTED (every 5–10 minutes)
OR
b) Create a small background worker or scheduled task inside the app that triggers the sync functions on an interval.

Pick the cleanest approach with Railway MCP. The goal is:

Employees refreshed daily

Repair orders and line items synced incrementally every few minutes

Verify end-to-end in the hosted environment
Once deployed and scheduled:

Hit the hosted sync endpoints directly on Railway (not localhost) to confirm they work, for example:
GET https://<railway-url>/api/sync/repair-orders?days_back=1&board=POSTED

Check Supabase to confirm that repair_orders, jobs, job_parts, job_labor, etc. have real data for JJ Auto

Confirm that sync_log and sync_cursors are being updated in the hosted environment

Append the results and any sample queries to docs/WAREHOUSE_PROGRESS.md

Ops Summary
At the end of your next reply, include an Ops Summary that clearly states:

The Railway service URL

Which env vars were set

How the sync schedule is configured (what runs, how often, via which mechanism)

How many ROs and related entities were synced in the first hosted run

Any TODOs or concerns

From this point on, assume the system is meant to run as a hosted service on Railway with Supabase as the warehouse. Do not give me local uvicorn or curl instructions; instead, use the MCP tools to manage deployment, env vars, and scheduling for me.
