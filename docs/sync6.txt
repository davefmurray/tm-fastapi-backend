The 30-day numbers are wrong. We should see roughly 400+ ROs in 30 days for this shop, not 68. Treat this as a blocking bug and investigate the cause of the low RO count.

Do a focused audit of how we select and sync ROs for the last 30 days and explain the problem in detail. Specifically, check:

Which endpoint(s) you are using to discover ROs

Are you only using the POSTED board from /job-board-group-by?

Are you also including COMPLETE or any other board/state?

Are there any hidden limits, paging, or default filters that might cap the number of ROs returned?

Which date field you are using for days_back filtering

Are you filtering by updatedDate, createdDate, postedDate, or something else?

For the last 30 days, list the min and max postedDate and createdDate for all synced repair_orders in Supabase.

Check if many older ROs within the 30-day window are being skipped because of a bad date condition.

Compare TM job-board vs Supabase counts
For the last 30 days:

Count how many ROs Tekmetric reports on the job board(s) you are using (POSTED, COMPLETE, etc.)

Compare that to how many repair_orders rows exist in Supabase for the same date range.

If Tekmetric returns ~400 ROs but we only have 68, show exactly where they are getting dropped in the sync pipeline.

Paging / Limits
Check if your job-board fetch logic:

handles pagination correctly

uses limit/offset or page parameters

might be stopping after the first page or first N results

Output
In your next response, I want:

A clear explanation of why we only ended up with 68 ROs for 30 days.

The corrected sync approach (which boards, which date fields, how paging works).

A plan to fix the sync logic so that a 30-day backfill truly reflects ALL relevant ROs in that period, not just a subset.

Then, after fixing, re-run a 30-day sync and give me updated repair_orders and ro_snapshots counts along with the RO count Tekmetric shows for the same period.

Do not move forward with any new dashboard work until this RO count issue is understood and fixed. This is a critical correctness problem.
