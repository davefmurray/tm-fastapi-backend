Drop the CSV import idea for now. I want to solve this by discovering and using more Tekmetric API endpoints, not manual reports.

We already know this: if the Tekmetric web UI can open a historical RO like this:

https://shop.tekmetric.com/admin/shop/6212/repair-orders/273591254/estimate

…then the browser is calling one or more backend API endpoints that return that RO’s data, even if it doesn’t show up on the job board.

Your job now is to switch into “endpoint discovery” mode and use Chrome DevTools MCP plus our existing /dev documentation to find those APIs and figure out how to use them for historical ROs.

Do the following:

Read our existing process in /dev
Look in the repo under /dev (or any docs we’ve written) for anything related to:

Chrome DevTools MCP usage

endpoint discovery

Tekmetric scraping or recording
Follow whatever process we already defined there so you stay consistent with how we want to discover endpoints.

Use Chrome DevTools MCP on that RO URL
Using Chrome DevTools MCP, load this page in the existing authenticated browser session:

https://shop.tekmetric.com/admin/shop/6212/repair-orders/273591254/estimate

Then:

Open the Network tab

Filter to XHR/fetch calls

Reload the page

Look for any calls that return JSON for this RO: endpoints containing “repair-order”, “estimate”, “history”, “search”, etc.
Document:

The full request URL(s)

HTTP method

Any query params (especially anything like date ranges, shopId, search filters)

Find how the UI lists historical ROs
Go in the UI (via DevTools MCP) to whatever page shows a list of past/historical/archived ROs (not just the job board). For example, any “All Repair Orders”, “History”, or “Search ROs” screen in Tekmetric.

Again:

Open Network

Filter to XHR/fetch

Change filters or date ranges in the UI

Capture the API calls that return lists of ROs

Your goal is to find one or more endpoints that:

Return lists of ROs for a date range

Work for older, archived ROs (not just what’s on the job board)

Let us request data by date range, status, or search term

Report back clearly
In your next reply, I want:

A list of the new endpoints you discovered (URL patterns, e.g. /api/repair-orders/search, /api/reporting/repair-orders, etc.)

For each endpoint, an example request and response shape

Your best guess at which endpoint we can use to pull historical RO data in bulk (by date range, status, etc.)

A proposal for how to integrate that endpoint (or endpoints) into our sync pipeline so we can fill in the missing ~500 ROs per 30-day period.

Do not talk about CSV again unless I ask. Focus completely on discovering and using the same API endpoints that the Tekmetric UI uses for historical ROs, starting from the example RO URL I gave you.
